      <p>Our crop recommendation model leverages machine learning to analyze key factors such as soil nutrients, weather
        conditions, and rainfall to provide informed agricultural decisions. By training multiple models, we've honed
        the accuracy and precision of our recommendations, ensuring that you receive the best advice for your land.</p>

      <h2>Explore Optimal Crops</h2>
      <p>Discover the ideal crops for your land by exploring the average conditions required for each crop. Our model
        takes into account nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to suggest
        the most suitable crops.</p>
